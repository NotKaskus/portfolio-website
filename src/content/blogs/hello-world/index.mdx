Sooooooooooooo. First of all, I believe introductions are in order. My name's Paul Andrew, though I commonly refer to myself as KASKUS online.

I started my journey into computer science at a very young age, starting with a discord bot. I soon moved on to using Typescript and Sapphirejs, 
building some standard simple, yet beautifully crafted discord bots (I had no idea there was a world of types out there).

It all started when i was a grade 8 student, That's when I stumbled upon the world of programming. My mission? Creating a Discord bot to 
automate some stuff in our discord server (Yes im a lazy person). Little did I know, this was the start of a coding adventure I never would 
have imagined.

I eventually became proficient with Javascript and Typescript. I used these tools to create Discord bots that looked good and performed their 
intended function.

And that leaves me with where I am today. It's currently our semester break and I will soon be attending our immersion. I'm also planning to 
focus more on programming after graduating senior highschool. I've learned to relax a little more these days and spend time playing Valorant 
and other games. As for what the future holds for me, I will never know. But I know that I'll enjoy the ride while I can and go with the flow. 
Thanks for reading!
