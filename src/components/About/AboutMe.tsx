          Hey, I&apos;m Paul Andrew. I&apos;m 17 years old and come from
          Philippines. I live in Naga City and spend my free time watching
          anime, do sports or enjoying time with friends and family.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I&apos;m into cars, which influenced my choice of the automotive
          strand in senior high school. After I graduated I plan to focus more
          on learning algorithms and data structures.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I&apos;m currently learning Python and Algorithims but my favorite
          language is Typescript. In the future I want to become a mechanic
          while still continue my tech journey.
