          Hey, I&apos;m Paul Andrew. I&apos;m 17 years old and come from
          Philippines. I live in Naga City and spend my free time watching
          anime, do sports or enjoying time with friends and family. I&apos;m
          doing full stack software development, building awesome softwares, and
          working on my personal projects.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I&apos;m passionate about technologies and cars, which influenced my
          choice of the automotive strand in senior high school. I have a strong
          desire to understand how things work and find the fastest and best way
          to make theme work. After graduation I plan to focus more on learning
          algorithms and data structures.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I&apos;m currently learning Python and Algorithims but my favorite
          language is Typescript. In the future I want to become a mechanic
          while still continue my tech journey. I may write more or rewrite this
          entire section later, but im leaving it as is for now because i want
          to publish this as soon as possible.
